      <h1>Dream Vacation</h1>
      <div className='text'>Imagine a place where the worries of everyday life melt away, 
        replaced by the gentle sound of waves lapping against the shore, 
        the scent of blooming flowers, and the warmth of the sun on your skin. <br/>
        A dream vacation is a journey to a destination that captivates your heart and soul, 
        offering a perfect blend of adventure, relaxation, and discovery. 
        Whether it‚Äôs the serene beaches of the Maldives, the historic charm of Kyoto, 
        or the breathtaking landscapes of Banff National Park, 
        a dream vacation is about creating unforgettable memories, 
        exploring new cultures, and finding a sense of peace and joy that lingers long after the trip is over. 
        It‚Äôs a time to reconnect with yourself, your loved ones, and the beauty of the world around you. üåç‚ú®
